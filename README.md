## README ##
This repository contains all the Octave code used for my programming assignments in the Machine Learning course of
Prof.Andrew Ng of Stanford University offered by Coursera during October - December 2011.

## Learning Material ##
### To the curious ones ###
The CS229 version offered at Stanford University seems to offer a more in-depth mathematical treatment involving proofs and extremely detailed
lecture notes. I downloaded some of them and posting them here on the hopes that it will be useful for you. Check the "Learning Material" folder.

*All the source code is posted with the intention that it will be useful for independent learners who are attempting the course and may be
are stuck at some point in the coding/learning process. You are ABSOLUTELY forbidden from copying this code and passing it off as your own work. 
If you are taking the ML class, please adhere to the Honor Code. An MOOC is the product of the hard work of a large number of people. Let us
not defeat its purpose*

## Honor Code ##
>We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get together 
with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming 
exercises, you are welcome to discuss them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; *we ask only that you not look at any 
source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students*
